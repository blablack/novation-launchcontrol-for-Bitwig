A Novation LaunchControl script for Bitwig-Studio
================================================

The User-Pages emmit midi events that can be used to midi-learn the knobs and buttons to in Bitwig.

The script is based on the work of [eduk](https://github.com/educk) and [ngradwohl](https://github.com/ngradwohl).

The knob takeover implementation is based on the work of [phaethon](https://github.com/phaethon).

The Factory-Pages are mapped to the following functions:
 * the left 8 knobs are mapped to Macro Functions
 * the right 8 knobs are mapped to Device Parameters
 * the buttons are mapped to Play, Record, Writing Arranger Automation, Loop, Click, Launcher Overdub, Overdub
