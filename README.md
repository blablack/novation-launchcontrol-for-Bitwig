novation-launchcontrol-for-Bitwig
=================================

Simple Novation LaunchControl script for Bitwig

Enable Factory preset 1 to use Macros and Parameters
Arrows enable moving around Bitwig Tracks and devices
All other Factory and User pages are assignable
Buttons on Factory 1 are a Transport and button 7+8 allows you to move around parameters

Script really needs parameter pickup so that they don't jump until the macro moves over the current setting, which I don't know how to do and would gladly accept any help.
